            <ul class="list1 style1 font5">
                <li> India’s electric vehicle (EV) market is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 90 per cent in this decade to touch $150 billion by 2030, a report by consulting firm RBSA Advisors stated. </li>
                <li>The Indian EV market is currently in its infancy and is estimated grow at CAGR of 90 per cent from 2021 to 2030</li>
                <li> In terms of penetration, EV sales accounts for barely 1.3 per cent of total vehicle sales in India during 20-21. However, the market is growing rapidly and is expected to be worth more </li>
                <li>  India's shift to shared, electric and connected mobility could help the country save nearly one giga-tonne of carbon dioxide emissions by 2030.
                </li>
                <li> EV technology evolution in India requires sizable investment in R&D and product development, both on the automobile platforms and battery/charging technology. Collective investment done by 2W, 3W, 4W, EV component makers and last mile delivery companies was recorded at Rs ~25,000 crore during January– July 2021.</li>
                <li>The spike in demand for EVs, led primarily due to a conducive regulatory framework, has in turn attracted overseas investments into the sector. Earlier this year, Ola electric raised $200 million from a clutch of investors in a fresh funding round, valuing the company at more than $5 billion..</li>
                <li> India needs about 400,000 charging stations to meet the requirement for two million EV that could potentially ply on its roads by 2026. To cater to this huge demand, an integrated work approach between the private sector and public sector is required. PSUs have been active in this regard in terms of providing the much-needed charging infrastructure. </li>
                <li> Globally, despite the COVID-19 pandemic related worldwide downturn in car sales, wherein global car sales dropped by 16 per cent in 2020, strong demand and momentum was seen in the global EV market where around 3 million electric cars were sold. </li> 
                <li> So we can conclude  by stating that it should be believed  that EVs are now the vehicles of the future and has the ability to power us ahead. </li>
