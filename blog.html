        <h1 class="font1"> What is an EV ? </h1>
        <p class="font2 style2"> Feeling guilty about your contribution to the rising carbon footprint? Fancy jumping on the ‘Go-Green’ bandwagon? Well, electric vehicles (EVs) are definitely one way to go about it. EVs are no longer just a hope for the future, they are here right now and on the cusp of a revolution. As is the case with anything new, the fear of the unknown is real. To allay those fears and help you make an informed decision, here is our comprehensive primer on EVs. The technology, why it is better, challenges, global picture, and a journey through the history books—we have it all covered. It is everything you need to know about EVs. </p>
        <p class="font2 style2"><b><u><i> Some of the common facts about EVs  which you must know !: </i></u></p>
            <ul class="list1 style1 font5">
                <li>An electric vehicle, or EV, has two major components: an electric motor (or two for all-wheel drive) and a battery pack that powers it. You won't find an internal combustion engine in a true EV, or a fuel pump, gas tank, or oil pan. No oil or smog checks necessary! </li>
                <li>Gas stations are useless for fully electric vehicles. Instead, you'll need to find a public charging station or plug in at home.</li>
                <li>Most people, however, don't need to charge their vehicle every day, explained Hannon Rasool, deputy director of the California Energy Commission’s fuels and transportation division.</li>

                <li>These days, EVs can travel 200 to even 500 miles before needing a charge. </li>

                <li>"The reality is most of us don’t drive more than 25 mile in a day," Rasool said in a recent call. Still, some drivers have "range anxiety," the fear that they'll run out of juice far from a charging station.</li>

                <li>About 75 percent of charging takes place at home, estimated Jeffrey Lu, an air pollution specialist who also works at the California Energy Commission</li>

                <li>There's Level 1 charging with a 120-volt plug that you'll find around your house for everyday appliances. With this low-level charger, an EV can take anywhere from eight to more than 16 hours to reach a full charge.</li>

                <li>Level 2 reaches 240 volts and is what your dryer outlet uses. With this faster charging level you can expect up to 20 to 30 miles of range added to the battery for every hour of charging. It takes up to eight hours to fully charge. You can have Level 2 charging installed at home.</li>
