        <p class="font2 style2"><b><u><i> Why EVs are better !  </i></u></p>
            <ul class="list1 style1 font5">
                <li> <b>Better for our planet </b> - Pure EVs have no tailpipe, so they donâ€™t emit any exhaust gases, which reduces local air pollution particularly in congested cities.</li>
                <li><b> No congestion charge </b> - Some areas are introducing Clean Air Zones with fees designed to discourage polluting vehicles from entering certain areas. A key benefit of an electric car is being exempt from these charges.</li>
                
                <li> <b> Better driving.</b> - EVs have more responsive acceleration and regenerative braking when easing off the accelerator. They tend to have a low centre of gravity, which improves handling, comfort and safety.</li>
                
                <li><b> EV grants </b> - There are a few schemes that help make a switch to drive electric cars. The government grants include help with charging points at home and at work as well as buying a new EV. </li>
            
                <li><b> Less noise </b> - EVs are much quieter than petrol and diesel vehicles. In fact, electric cars are so quiet, they are now required by law to have an Acoustic Vehicle Alert System (AVAS) to emit a sound when reversing or travelling below 12mph (19km/h).</li>

                <li><b> Better resale value </b>- Second-hand electric cars could be a great affordable option if you're looking to make the switch from petrol. It's worth remembering too the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles will be banned from 2030.</li>
